# Advent of Code 2016
Repository for solved exercises of [advent of code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016). 

*Coded in python language.*

NOTE: *I have since dropped trying to solve everything, since changing countries and starting a PhD can be time (and mind) consuming. I may come back to these challege later, but most likely I'll just skip right to AoC2017*
